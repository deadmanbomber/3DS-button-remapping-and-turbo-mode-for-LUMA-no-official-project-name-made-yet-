this is just a group effort to make a turbo mode and a button remapper for the 3DS in LUMA. 

features planned:

full button remapper (can even assign multiple buttons to the same input)
TURBO MODE (with configurable button combo and adjustable speed)
Custom presets
make new button inputs by pressing multiple buttons at once

i am in no way a programmer, so this might take some time
